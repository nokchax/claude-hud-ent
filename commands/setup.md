description: Configure claude-hud as your statusline
---

Add this exact statusLine configuration to ~/.claude/settings.json:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

IMPORTANT: Use the literal string `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` exactly as shown - do NOT resolve or expand it. Claude Code will resolve this variable at runtime to the correct plugin path.

Merge with existing settings. Do not overwrite other fields.

After updating, confirm success. The HUD appears immediately - no restart needed.
